# JavaScript FP & FRP & OOP & Design Patterns Practice

## Purpose

This practice covers the following:

1. *FP* & *FRP* basics.
2. *OOP* & *Design Patterns* in *JS*.
3. New *ECMAScript* features.
4. *BDD* with *Mocha* and *Chai*.
5. Frontend workflow/project setup (*Browserify*, *Babel*, *ESLint*).

Also touches the following:

1. *DOM* API.
2. *Canvas 2D* and optimized rendering.
3. *Touch* events API.

### Overview

...

<!-- This compound task has been conceived as play ground for design patterns practice.
The final decision should look like material points system simulator.
A lot of points bouncing and moving around through fancy paths ;) -->

### Tasks

...

<!-- 0. Review already implemented modules to discover or repeat some ES6 basic theory.
1. Implement *DissipativeForce* and *GravityForce*. Add them to the "scene".
2. Implement *PointsSystemFactory* (abstract factory pattern) to generate systems with different "configurations" (wheel, bridge, house, or any physical object you want).
3. Refactor view layer to meet better architecture. Use *MVC* pattern.
4. Implement *TouchBasedController* to move points by tapping and dragging them. Use *PointTouchEventEmitter* module. -->

<!-- Additional:

Extend controller's layer to control different physical parameters (gravity constant, dissipative constant, and so on). -->

### Steps

...

<!-- 1. Fork this repository.
2. Checkout forked repository.
1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install project dependencies by `npm install`.
3. Run tests by `npm run test`.
4. Run project in development mode `npm run dev` and open *localhost:8080*.
5. Go to the *src* folder and implement tasks listed above.
6. As necessary part of implementation write tests inside *test* folder.
7. And don't forget to commit working decision ;) -->
